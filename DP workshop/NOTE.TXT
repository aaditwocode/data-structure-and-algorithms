DP Patterns and Their Forms

 FORM (Form 0)**

* **Description:** Dividing a set or sequence into parts or subsets.
* **Characteristics:** Typically involves choices like partitioning or grouping.
* **Common DP Types:** LEVEL, CHOICE, CHECK, MOVE
* **Example Problems:**

  * Climbing Stairs
  * Partition problems

---

**TAKE OR NOT TAKE FORM (Form 1)**

* **Description:** Decision to include or exclude the current element.
* **Characteristics:** Usually binary choice at each step.
* **Example Problems:**

  * Subset Sum
  * Knapsack
  * Skill-based selection problems

---

**BEST ANSWER UP TO THAT ELEMENT (Form 2)**

* **Description:** Keep track of the best answer up to the current index.
* **Characteristics:** Deals with path/sequence/subarray dependencies.
* **Example Problems:**

  * Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
  * Maximum Path Sum

---

**FINDING COMMON IN SUBSEQUENCES (Form 3)**

* **Description:** Multi-sequence DP problems finding commonalities like longest common subsequence.
* **Characteristics:** Comparing two or more sequences.
* **Example Problems:**

  * Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
  * Edit Distance (can fit here too)

---

**LR DP (Form 4)**

* **Description:** DP on intervals (left and right indices) to find best answers within a range.
* **Characteristics:** Focus on subproblems defined by ranges or segments.
* **Example Problems:**

  * Rod Cutting
  * Matrix Chain Multiplication
  * Palindrome Partitioning

---

**GAME DP (Form 5)**

* **Description:** Turn-based or multi-step games with states defined by moves.
* **Characteristics:** Often uses pruning, base case caching, and memoization. Lookahead 4/5 steps common.
* **Example Problems:**

  * Nim Game
  * Optimal Strategy for a Game
  * Stone Game
